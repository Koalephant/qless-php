## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Introduced `Qless\Jobs\JobHandlerInterface` so that `Worker::registerJobPerformHandler` will require
  that its argument is implements the JobHandlerInterface interface
- Added all the required PHP extensions to the Composer's `require` section so that
  now Composer will check dependencies on library installation time
- Added support of default Worker's `perform` method
- Added `Qless\Events\QlessCoreEvent` DTO and `Qless\Events\QlessCoreEventFactory` to interact with qless-core events
- Added `Qless\Client::getWorkerName` to provide default worker name
- Added ability to select the redis database
- Added the `Qless\Queues\Collection` for accessing queues lazily
- Added the `Qless\Workers\Collection` for accessing workers lazily
- Workers now can set/get its own name via `setName`/`getName`
- Added job reservers (ordered, round robin, shuffled round robin)
- Added `Qless\Jobs\RecurringJob` to wrap recurring jobs
- Added basic event system
- Added initial `qlessd` daemon
- Added ability to adjust a job's priority while it's still waiting in a queue

### Changed
- PHP 5.x no longer supported. Minimal required version is 7.1
- Updated qless-core
- Move `Qless\Lua` to the `Qless\LuaScript`
- Move `Qless\Listener` to the `Qless\Subscribers\QlessCoreSubscriber`
- Move `Qless\Job` to the `Qless\Jobs\BaseJob`
- Move `Qless\Jobs` to the `Qless\Jobs\Collection`
- Move `Qless\Worker` to the `Qless\Workers\ForkingWorker`
- Move `Qless\Queue` to the `Qless\Queues\Queue`
- More code quality improvements to follow the SRP. Thus the code base for almost all classes has been changed
- Move all the exceptions to the common `Qless\Exceptions` namespace
- Changed `Qless\Queues\Queue::put` signature from the `put($className, $jid, $data, ...)`
  to the `put(string className, array $data, ?string $jid = null, ...)`
- Now `Qless\Queues\Queue::pop` does not require the mandatory presence of the worker name as its 1st argument.
  If the the worker name is not passed the `Qless\Client::getWorkerName` will be used
- Now calling `Qless\Queues\Queue::pop` without 2nd argument (number of jobs to pop off of the queue) will return
  `Qless\Jobs\BaseJob|null` so that there is no need to play with arrays like `$job[0]->function()`
- Rework job classes to remove no longer needed getters
- Changed signature of the `Qless\Jobs\BaseJob::requeue` from `requeue(array $opts = []): string` to
  `requeue(?string $queue = null, array $opts = []): string` so that there is an ability to move job to a new queue
- Changed signature of the `Qless\Queues\Queue::put` so that `resources`, `replace` and `interval` no longer used 
- Changed signature of the `Qless\Queues\Queue::recur` from
  ```php
  Queue::recur(
      $klass,
      $jid,
      $data,
      $interval = 0,
      $offset = 0,
      $retries = 5,
      $priority = 0,
      $resources = [],
      $tags = []
  )
  ```
  to
  ```php
  Queue::recur(
      string $className,
      array $data,
      ?int $interval = null,
      ?int $offset = null,
      ?string $jid = null,
      ?int $retries = null,
      ?int $priority = null,
      ?int $backlog = null,
      ?array $tags = null
  )
  ```
  to follow actual qless-core API

### Removed
- Fully refactor the `Qless\Client` class and removed no longer used code
- Removed no longer required `Qless\Qless::fork` and `pcntl_fork` check
- Removed no longer needed `Qless\Qless` class
- Removed no longer needed `Qless\Job::fromJobData`
- Removed no longer supported by qless-core `Qless\Resource`, `Qless\Job::getResources` and `Qless\Job::getInterval`
- The `Qless\Client::paused` no longer provided by qless-core (but we're saved `Qless\Queues\Queue::isPaused`)

### Fixed
